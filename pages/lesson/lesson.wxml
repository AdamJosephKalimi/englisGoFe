      (This text will be the lesson)
      (Our topic for today will be talking about motivation.
      Please make sure to create 1. Written and 2. Spoken entry for me to be able to give you feedback on both.

      We all need to be motivated.  Whether you need to be motivated for work, you want to achieve a personal goal (like learning a language), or overcome       a challenge, we all need motivational boost from time to time.

      TO DO:
      Why does this seem to work so well for you?
      If you don't have a fitness routine, write out your fitness goals.

      Please make sure that you complete the written and spoken portions so that I can give you good
      feedback on both. If you have any questions about the assignment or words, please let me know)
